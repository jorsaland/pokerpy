Basic money logic is implemented, including mandatory bets and 'stack atoms' that represent indivisible chips. By now, the smallest betting or raising amount is the stack atom, no matter previous aggressive actions. There are no secondary pots either. If a player goes all-in and faces a raise, the only option is to fold.
