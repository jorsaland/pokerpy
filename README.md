# PokerPy under development! (Alpha version)
Basic money logic is implemented, including a smallest chip value and validations on action amounts. By now, the smallest betting or raising amount is the smallest chip, no matter if there were previous aggressive actions. Stacks are infinite, making it impossible to go all-in and creating side pots.

### 0.4.0

- Started from version *0.3.1* and received feature updates from versions *0.0.1*, *0.1.3*, *0.2.2* and *0.3.2*, including unit tests, features and deprecations.
